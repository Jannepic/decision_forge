# Decision Forge

Decision Forge is a decision-clarity app.

You describe a real decision you’re stuck with.
Decision Forge breaks it down, exposes trade-offs, highlights opportunity costs,
and delivers a clear verdict with a concrete next step.

No motivation.
No therapy.
No productivity noise.

Just structured thinking, forced clarity, and a decision you can act on.

## What it does
- Analyzes multiple options objectively
- Reveals hidden costs, risks, and cognitive bias
- Weighs decisions based on your priorities (money, growth, peace)
- Delivers a clear verdict with reasoning
- Defines the next action to take within 24 hours

## What it is not
- Not a to-do app
- Not a habit tracker
- Not a mental health app
- Not here to make you feel comfortable

## Who it’s for
- People who overthink and delay important decisions
- Builders, creators, traders, and students
- Anyone tired of vague “it depends” answers

## Core principle
If a decision matters, avoiding it is already a decision.
Decision Forge exists to end that loop.
